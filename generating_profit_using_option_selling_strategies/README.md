- Option sellers make money through taking advantage of time value of option.
- Theoretically, option buyers take limited risk and gain unlimited profit, while option sellers have limited profit and unlimited risk. Options allow investors to create unique strategies to take advantage of different characteristics of the market â€” like volatility and time decay.
- Options are called derivatives for two reasons: the first is that option trading is derived from stock and futures trading; and the other is that option price always depends on (derives from) the value of the underlying asset, be it stock, index or some commodity.
- Many investors have avoided options, believing them to be sophisticated and, therefore, too difficult to understand.
- The improper use of options, like that of any powerful tool, can lead to major problems. Finally, words like "risky" or "dangerous" have been incorrectly 
attached to options by the financial media and certain popular figures in the market.
- Three major conclusions from options trading
  - On average, three of every four options held to expiration expire worthless (the exact percentage was 76.5%).
  - The share of puts and calls in options that expire worthless is influenced by the primary trend of the underlying market.
  - Option sellers still come out ahead even when they are going against the trend.
- No matter what the market is doing, time is constantly, albeit slowly, eroding the value of the option. While the option can gain value from market movement,
time will always be with option sellers, working for them and against option buyers.
- Selling options avoids the needs of perfect timing of the market. Thus option seller has significant holding power in the market and is able to ride out short-term market fluctuations.
- Finally, regardless of the label of unlimited risk in selling short options, option selling risk can be just definable and controlled as any other type of futures or stock trading risk. The risk of options selling can be controlled by future, stock or even option.
