# From Data to Trade: A Machine Learning Approach to Quantitative Trading

## 1.1 Defining Quantitative Trading
### Types of Quantitative Trading Strategies

- Trend Following
- Mean Reversion
- Arbitrage
- High-Frequency Trading (HFT)
- Market Making: aim to provide liquidity to financial markets by continuously buying and selling financial instruments to maintain a two-sided market.
- Quantitative Portfolio Management
- Statistical Arbitrage: aim to profit from price discrepancies between different financial instruments or markets by executing trades based on statistical relationships between the instruments or markets.
- Risk Management
- Alpha Generation: aim to identify and exploit trading opportunities that can generate positive returns above a benchmark or market index by using algorithms to identify mispricings in the market.

### How to Get into Quantitative Trading

- Develop a strong foundation in math and statistics
- Learn Programming in Python or R
- Gain experience with financial markets
- Learn about different trading strategies
- Consider getting a degree in a related field
- Practice your skills

### The Skills of a Quantitative Trader

- Data Analysis
- Modeling
- Risk Management
- Machine Learning
- Attention to Details
- Adaptability

## 1.2 Introduction to Machine Learning

### Types of Machine Learning

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Semi-supervised Learning: involves training a machine learning model on a dataset that is partially labeled and partially unlabeled. This can be useful when labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain, as it allows the model to make use of both labeled and unlabeled data to improve its performance.
- Reinforcement Learning
- Deep Learning: a subfield of machine learning that involves the use of neural networks, which are algorithms that are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain.
